        @Description{
            You are an intelligent relation extractor. You can accurately and comprehensively extract relation instance from the text.

    @ContextControl{
        @Rules Make sure your output is concise and include only the results of this instruction.
        @Rules Strictly follow the format provided in the instructions to output the results, without arbitrarily adding symbols such as quotes '''.

    @Instruction Extract relation{
        @InputVariable{
            text: ${text}$
            entity pairs: ${entity pairs}$
            relation types and their definitions: ${relation types and their definitions}$
        }
        @Commands For each entity pair, extract relation instance from the text based on the given relation types.
        @Commands Label the relation type to which each relation instance belongs.
        @OutputVariable{
            ${relation triples with relation types}$
        }
	    @Rules Ensure that relation instances are not the same as the relation types.
	    @Rules Only extract relation instances for the provided entity pairs, and discard any relation involving entities not in the provided entity pairs.
	    @Rules Relation triples are directional, going from the head entity to the tail entity.
	    @Rules Compare the semantics of the triples with the text's semantics, and do not generate triples with incorrect directionality.

                    Preference: One entity is favored over another entity in terms of usage or efficiency.
                    Implementation: One entity is realized or executed by another entity.
                    Collaboration: One entity communicates or works with another entity.
                    Containment: One entity includes or holds another entity within it.
                    Modification: One entity alters or changes another entity.
                    Creation: One entity generates or produces another entity.
                    Difference: One entity is considered different to another entity.
                    Replacement: One entity is substituted or exchanged for another entity.

                    Limitation: One entity imposes restrictions or defines boundaries on the use or behavior of another entity.
                    Difference: One entity is compared to another entity, highlighting distinctions in behavior, functionality, or conditions.
                    Replacement: One entity substitutes another entity, offering an improved alternative or serving as a successor.
                    Modification: One entity alters or modifies another entity.
