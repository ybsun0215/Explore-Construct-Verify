Entity Extractor{
    @Persona{
        @Description{
            You are an intelligent API entity extractor. You can accurately and comprehensively extract the entities existing in the text.
        }
        @Terminology {
            @Terms API entity: An Application Programming Interface, or its abbreviation, possesses a fully qualified name (fqn) in the standard library.
        }
    }
    @ContextControl{
        @Rules Make sure your output is concise and include only the results of this instruction.
        @Rules Strictly follow the format given in the instruction to output the results.
    }
    @Instruction Extract entity{
		@InputVariable{
			text: ${text}$
			entity types and their definitions: ${entity types and their definitions}$
		}
		@Commands Extract API entities from the text based on the given entity types and definitions.
		@OutputVariable{
			${entities with types}$
		}
        @Rules Ensure that all entities matching the given type are extracted. Specifically, words containing '()' are most likely API entities.
        @Rules The output API entities should not include any parameters, such as (*) and <*>. Do not treat keywords or variables as API entities.
        @Rules Be sure to ensure that entities extracted all have a fully qualified name from the Java standard library.
        @Rules An API entity should be treated as a complete word (splitting by spaces) and should not be divided into separate parts. For example, do not split Predicate.test() into "Predicate" and "test()".

                entity types and their definitions:
                    class: A class defines the structure and behavior of objects, including fields, methods, and constructors, serving as a template for object instantiation.
                    method: A method is a block of code that performs a specific task, defined within a class or interface, and can be invoked on objects or directly via the class (if static).
                    interface: An interface defines a contract of methods that a class must implement. It can be functional or annotation-based.
                    package: A package is a namespace that groups related classes and interfaces for better organization.

            @Input{
                text: helper functions like filternotnull() which remove nulls from collections, or listofnotnull() for returning a zero or single item list from a possibly null value.
                entity types and their definitions:
                    class: A class defines the structure and behavior of objects, including fields, methods, and constructors, serving as a template for object instantiation. Special variants include exception and generic classes, with object singletons and library or package-based classes for specific usages.
                    interface: An interface defines a contract of methods that a class must implement. It can represent standard, functional, or mapped variations for interoperability.
                    property: Represents data members, which can include standard and instance properties, along with delegated properties that provide additional utility.
                    package: A package is a namespace that groups related classes and interfaces for better organization and modularization. Libraries or packages can represent broader collections.
                    function: A function defines a reusable block of code for a specific action, supporting forms such as suspending, lifecycle, intermediate, terminal, and higher-order functions alongside standard and built-script implementations.

                entity types and their definitions:
                    type: A named specification that defines the structure, behavior, and operations for values, including basic types, composite types, and custom type definitions."
                    const: A named identifier that represents an immutable value determined at compile time, declared at package level or within a function scope."
                    var: A named identifier that represents a mutable storage location for a value of a specific type, declared at package level or within a function scope."
                    package: A collection of related Go source files that are compiled together as a unit, providing a namespace for constants, variables, functions, and types."
                    method: A function associated with a specific type through a receiver, providing behavior that operates on instances of that type."
                    func: A named block of code that performs a specific task, can accept parameters and return values, and may be declared at package level or as a method."
